# AD-EntraID-Offboarding
**Automated offboarding for Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).**
*This PowerShell script provides a GUI-based workflow to help system administrators seamlessly offboard employees from both on-prem and cloud environments.*

# ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure the following PowerShell modules and assemblies are available:

**Required PowerShell Modules**
```
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
```
**Required .NET Assemblies**
```
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing
